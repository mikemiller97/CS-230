**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**

The client was a gaming company who wanted to expand their game onto various operating systems. They wanted me to make the game able to run on a website which can be accessed across the common operating systems on computers and mobile devices.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**

I believe what I did the best in developing this documentation is thurough commenting which described the changes I made to the given code. This made it so the company could fully understand the changes I made.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**

The design document gave me a clear direction to go when developing the code. It let me know what was needed and what expectations to meet.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

If I could pick one part to revise, it would be the overall look of the final design. As it stands, the log in is set up in a standard alert box but I believe it would look better as its own page.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

I interpreted the user's needs of having the website work across platforms when making the software design. It is is important to consider the user's needs because the most important thing is to meet the clients expectations.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**

In designing this software, I researched any desired coding patterns I was unfamiliar with on websites such as stackoverflow and the textbook of the course. I would do the same research in the future rather than asking the professor/a colleague first because in the world of software development the most important skill one can learn is self-reliance. Researching a problem on one's own rather than taking the time of another person is a more effective way to learn and does not make one dependent on others to develop good code.
